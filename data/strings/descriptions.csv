DR_planet_new_terra,CUSTOM,"New Terra is the capital of the domain reformed. Propagandized as an earthly paradise by many across the sector, it is covered almost completely in ruins from the domain era. The entire planet has been given over to ruin restoration efforts. Due to this fact, no mega-corporations have been given special economic zones on the planet for heavy industry. Access has been heavily restricted ever since a Luddic path assassin nearly assassinated director Ivanov. The population is made up entirely of first class citizen comprised of veterans, high ranking government officials and rich oligarchs.",,,
DR,FACTION,"“My name is Yahya Ivanov and I have a pair of questions for you: is a people’s success not determined by how they govern themselves? Has the sector been worse since the collapse?”
In c+ 181 after the destruction of Opis, a young man appeared with a message that resonated across the entire sector. It was this: The decline of the sector was because the Hegemony did not go far enough to be like the domain, and the people of the sector must set out into wild space and one day restore the domain to its previous glory.  This man was Yahya Ivanov a former student of the Opis Academy’s College of History, and he had a dream of rebirth.
The Domain Reformed, Domain, DR, or Adonis special autonomous zone (if you ask a hegemony official), hegemonies mad dog is a hyper-reactionary nostalgia state.  It is obsessed with copying all of the old dominion’s outward trappings, It puts great effort into managing its image across the sector.  portraying itself as an oasis of prosperity, democracy, and order amongst the endless chaos and despotism of the rest of the sector.
In the ruins of an old university the legendary archaeologist James, black tail, Sparks found a computer with a series of unencrypted ship blueprints. Ever since the dominion reformed has used these warships. They Insist that they were the next generation of designs to be used by the Domain right before the collapse despite the insistence of credible historians and the XIV battlegroup that this is not true. 
The Domain reformed government is modeled after that of the domains with one very important difference. The position of Director. The Director is an absolute dictator that can countermand any policy from the democratic government and dictate the direction of the nation at will. The domain reformed has had only one Director. Its founder Yahya Ivanov. Many argue that this means the domain reformed is a dictatorship and not a true rebirth of the domain of man. If you were to bring this up to Yahya Ivanov he would tell you that when a state is in a time of distress a director becomes necessary and insist that he will step down when the time is right. Then he would give you a lecture on early Roman history. 
The DR economy is built on heavy industry and weapons manufacturing. The DR, to build up the military-industrial complex necessary to protect itself from other factions, designated all areas not covered in ruins or rebuilt ruins as special economic zones for industries conducive to the arms industry. Resulting in one of the strangest economies in the sector, where a bag of potatoes is worth its weight in Gauss rifles. Corruption has become a way of life as a matter of survival for most, and profit for a few.  The Domain reformed has become the sectors arms factory. Thousands of immigrants slave away in these zones and in the military dreaming of the day, they will be selected to purchase one of the apartments rebuilt from the ruins. In these renovated areas people live based on what Ivanov thinks life was like back during the domain. High-paying jobs are easy to find in these idealistic areas. This has led to the rise of oligarchs ruling that hold almost as much power as Director Ivanov.
  The Domain Reformed is legally a part of hegemony. The Domain Reformed gains protection and the Hegemony gets a source of cannon fodder and not having to deal with the problem right now. Both sides are aware of how this must eventually end. The DR hates the Luddic church for destroying domain-era artifacts and absolutely despises the Luddic path for trying to assassinate their beloved director.",,,
DR_planet_Ilyin,CUSTOM,"Illyn is the oil soaked, blood soaked hell of the persean sector. It is also the most populated world in the Metternich system. Due to having the smallest amount of ruins most of the world has been handed over to mega-corporations for arms manufacturing. Because of this Illyn has become the industrial heart of the system. It’s a common saying that more weapons flow from Illyin than water in its rivers.  The rampant over-industrialization has resulted in extreme levels of pollution that have reduced its temperature even lower than regular tundra worlds as not enough light can get in. Most residents have chosen detoxifier lungs as their state substized domain era verified* legally mandated cybernetic. Gang warfare is quite common on this planet as the Mega Corps compete to expand their pseudo-fiefdoms and . A sizable proportion of weapons used across the sector are manufactured here due to the Domain's Laissez-faire policy of letting companies set up shop here.",,,
DR_planet_Burke,CUSTOM,Burke is the breadbasket of the Metternich system. Thousands of farmers slave away under the baking sun alongside the many rivers of this world.  Most rural immigrants to the Domain Reformed are sent to this world to bolster the DR’s weak agriculture sector. This world is also the epicenter of luddic path resistance in the DR. This is because many apostates rediscover their faith through The Witnessing due to how they are treated. A massive guerrilla war is constantly being waged between the DR military and Luddic Path terrorists across the dunes. ,,,
DR_planet_Maistre,CUSTOM,"Mariste is a brutal prison world.  The people who reside here are career criminals, political prisoners, terrorists, and the few brave pioneers willing to tough it out for great riches. On this world, hundreds of criminals slave away digging up the mineral riches of the world to fuel the arms manufacturing sector. They are locked in battle with the jungle and the local megafauna for survival. A steady stream of outside personnel is necessary to keep the population steady. ",,,

#Ships,,,,,
StLouis,SHIP,"The most beautiful ship used by the domain and a personal favorite of director Ivanov, this warship can enter and exit the atmosphere with its own power. This has made it a common sight in the many parades Director Ivanov constantly orders. A capable gunboat for those with a love for theatrics.",,,
Trireme,SHIP,A  small cargo transport with decent enough . This ship makes use of archaic solar sail technology. This allows for an incredible max speed and almost nonexistent fuel consumption at the cost of acceleration. Luddic path zealots are known for using these ships as suicide rams.,,,
bismark,SHIP,"A favorite among older pirate lords and the more ""disciplinarian inclined"" admirals, the Bismark is an incredibly durable battleship with a very intimidating image, the Bismark-class fills a vital middle point between conquest and a paragon across the sector. with heavy armor and good firepower the Bismark is the backbone of any fleet it finds itself in.  When the first Bismark launched from the Illyn the admirals cheered at the glory of the Dominion. The dockworkers lamented the amount of suffering it had taken to build it, and its soon-to-be sisters.",,,
hosho,SHIP,the Hosho class is a light carrier primarily used to provide fuel and void superiority for small patrols and trade convoys A deeply underappreciated but good ship class.,,,
Queen_Elizabeth,SHIP,A technologically advanced super carrier with enough void craft to blockade an entire world. They were the first ships to be used in the sector bearing the designation of super carrier A mark of pride among the dominion admiralty. The course of entire battles has been changed by the timely intervention of these beasts. They are a favorite to use as flagships due to it in built-in commander center and powerful sensors. ,,,
reactivated Domain Mothership,SHIP,Whenever a Domain mother ship is found out in the deep void the domain Reformed Spares no expense in restoring them to active duty in one role or another. These ships are considered a relic to be protected and cared for like a lost child. The Most common role these ships fill is as a strategic logistic support ship. A single one of these is enough to provide enough supplies for an entire planetary invasion.,,,
petya,SHIP,An relatively advanced ship by domain reformed standards. Using a lot of midline grade technology this missile frigate is a good old dependable ship with an impressive missile barrage. A great ship for an patient captain with an love of tundra worlds.,,,
Virginia,SHIP,"The Virginia class is more a floating wedge of steel than a warship. The Virginia class is an excellent brawler with a great barrage, versatile weapon load out, and crazy levels of armor. This ship has an rivalry with the monitor for which frigate class is the most durable",,,
Wichita,SHIP,A heavy cruiser with impressive firepower and heavy Armour The Witicha class in a great brawler that form the front line of domain and pirate fleets.,,,
indianopolis,SHIP,A heavy cruiser with incredible PD layout the Indianapolis is the solution to any  bombing run. Theses are usually deployed against high tech and midline fleets to counter powerful wings.,,,
popov,SHIP,The single most hated ship in use by domain. The Popov is a nearly indestructible circle of Armour with a gun too large for its flux network and a nonexistent pd capability. their crews are notorious for vacuum proof armor dreading the moment when the next missile slams into the hull.,,,
Conte_di_Cavour,SHIP,A very unique battleship design with only heavy weapon mounts.  This Conte_di_Cavour  is quite controversial due to it's requirement of heavy weapons to be available and the abysmally slow speed.,,,
yorktown,SHIP,A low tech replacement for an Astral. The York town class has  impressive wing manufacturing ability for it's price and an absurd amount of pd weapons and surprisingly difficult to destroy. This class of ships is incredibly well loved by   It's a good ship just keep it away from the front lines.,,,
Moskva,SHIP,A missile cruiser with incredible alpha strike capability. It's designed to be a hard counter to capital-class carriers or anything that can't get out of the way of it's missiles  ,,,
Furious,SHIP,A medium carrier that provides flexibility and support.  This is the most common and useful ship in the domain's fleets. It's proven vital in creating patrols to counter Luddic path fleets trying to resupply terrorists on Burke. ,,,
Lion,SHIP,"An improvement on the legion battle carrier design with a smaller frontal profile, better flux dissipation, and armor layout.
Before the collapse, on the world now known as New Terra a pair of college students in the Viotov College of Engineering came into possession of an experimental AI core. While looking for a buyer they forced the ai core to retrofit ancient Terran water-based warship designs to function as void-craft for their amusement. The lion class is the first of these redesigns. It was before further restrictions and instructions were placed on the AI to stay closer to the original design. Eventually the students were found out and the blueprints became a novelty among intellectual groups.  The lion class is more inspired by rather than a retrofit.  It provides all the capability of a legion battle carrier with an improved frontal profile and better flux network. The quality of the design is a testament to the intelligence that designed its brilliance.",,,
Tashkent,SHIP,"The Tashkent class is a super destroyer with , by DR standards, great speed. The ship has found its primary use in the sector as a decent combat freighter because of that great speed and large cargo bay. Smugglers have found a particular liking for the ship.",,,
yamato,SHIP,One of the largest ships in the sector the Yamato class is the DR’s answer to the paragon. The Yamato-class has near impervious Armour and impressive fire power at the cost of speed and you would have to be blind to miss something this large.,,,
Ford,SHIP,"More a massive floating city than a ship the ford class are the perfect ships to act as the heart for an invasion fleet. The ford class can sustain  a huge amount of fighter craft ,and is quite durable due to the size is Armour effect. The construction of a single one of these requires the combined effort of multiple planets. 

Many admirals in the Domain Reformed dislike these ships due to the advanced technology used in some parts and the reputation the ship has for malfunctions.
",,,
Geobukseon,SHIP,The Geobukseon is a holding ship with great staying power and decent broadside. It is the anvil to an bombing runs hammer. Geobukseon crews are infamous for weaning power armor dreading the moment when the next missile slams into the hull.,,,

#weapons,,,,,
type_94,WEAPON,"“The type 94 is a massive weapon consisting of three combustible light gas guns housed in a heavily armored turret in a dedicated anti-capital ship role. These guns work by igniting  a fuel mixture of hydrogen, liquid oxygen, and helium to propel an armor penetrating round with an antimatter charge.  HEGINT assets report test firing , using the example “acquired freely” from the self proclaimed Domain of Man, displays impressive velocity and range due to a flaw in the gas ignition system resulting in inaccuracy and slow reloading times. Recommend no sabotage or adoption."" - Classified report to the High Hegemon
",,,
360,WEAPON,"“The Quadruple 380 mm/45 Modele is comprised of four  macrons for suppressing enemy shields. These macrons fire a stream of millions of micrometer sized carbon macaroni filled with uranium-235 at incredibly fast speeds. On contact fission is achieved  creating millions of tiny explosions each eating away at the target. While this particular implantation of macron technology is inefficient a single gun version has a lot of potential as a cheaper replacement for the ion beam due to it’s incredible EMP generation potential and comparative ease of manufacture.  Recommend technology transfer."" - Classified report to the High Hegemon ",,,

DR_planet_new_terra,CUSTOM,"New Terra is the capital of the domain reformed. Propagandized as an earthly paradise by many across the sector, it is covered almost completely in ruins from the domain era. The entire planet has been given over to ruin restoration efforts. Due to this fact, no mega-corporations have been given special economic zones on the planet for heavy industry. Access has been heavily restricted ever since a Luddic path assassin nearly assassinated director Ivanov. The population is made up entirely of first class citizen comprised of veterans, high ranking government officials and rich oligarchs.",,,
DR,FACTION,"“My name is Yahya Ivanov and I have a pair of questions for you: is a people's success not determined by how they govern themselves? Has the sector been worse since the collapse?”
In c+ 181 after the destruction of Opis, a young man appeared with a message that resonated across the entire sector. It was this: The decline of the sector was because the Hegemony did not go far enough to be like the domain, and the people of the sector must set out into wild space and one day restore the universe to its halcyon past.  This man was Yahya Ivanov, a former student of the Opis Academy’s College of History, and he had a dream of rebirth. Thus began the Domain Reconstructionists movement.
The Domain Reformed, Domain, DR, Adonis special autonomous zone (if you ask a hegemony official), Hegemonies mad dog or New Domain is a hyper-reactionary irredentist nostalgia state.  It is obsessed with trying to be like the old domain. Especially the outer trappings and symbols. The domain reformed puts great effort into managing its public image across the sector.  portraying itself as an oasis of prosperity, democracy, and order among the endless chaos, despotism and barbarism of the rest of the sector.
The Domain Reformed government is loosely based on that of the Domains with one very important difference. The position of Director. The Director is an absolute dictator that can countermand any policy from the democratic government and dictate the direction of the nation at will. The domain reformed has had only one Director. Its founder Yahya Ivanov. Many argue that this means the domain reformed is a dictatorship and not a true rebirth of the Domain of Man. If you were to bring this up to Yahya Ivanov he would tell you that when a state is in a time of distress a dictator becomes necessary and insist that he will step down when the time is right. Then give you a one hour lecture on early Roman history. 
In the ruins of an old university the legendary archaeologist James, black tail, Sparks found a data pad with a series of unencrypted ship blueprints. Ever since the Dominion Reconstructionists have primarily used these warships. They Insist that they were the next generation of designs intended to be used by the Domain right before the collapse despite the insistence of credible historians and the XIV battlegroup that this is not true.
The DR economy is built on heavy industry and weapons manufacturing. The Domain Reconstructionists to build up the military-industrial complex necessary to protect itself from other factions designated all areas not covered in ruins or renovated ruins as special economic zones for businesses related to the military industrial complex. Resulting in one of the strangest economies in the sector, where a combat mech is worthless than a house. The Domain Reformed has become the sector's arms factory open to any with deep enough pockets.This has led to the rise of oligarchs that hold almost as much power as Director Ivanov Thousands of immigrants slave away in these zones and in the military dreaming of the day, they will be selected to become first class citizens and purchase one of the apartments rebuilt from the ruins from the Domain era. In these renovated areas people live based on what the Domain Reconstructionists think life was like back during the domain. High-paying jobs are easy to find ,and comprehensive social programs are quick  to access in these idealistic places. 
 The Domain Reformed is technically a part of hegemony. The Domain Reconstructionists gain a degree of security from the “seditious savages”. The Hegemony gets a source of cannon fodder and not having to deal with the Domain Reconstructionists problem right now. Both sides are aware of how this relationship must eventually end. The Domain Reconstructionists hate the Luddic church in particular for destroying domain-era artifacts and absolutely despise the Luddic path for trying to assassinate their beloved director.

DR_planet_Ilyin,CUSTOM,"Illyn is the oil soaked, blood soaked hell of the persean sector. It is also the most populated world in the Metternich system. Due to having the smallest amount of ruins most of the world has been handed over to mega-corporations for arms manufacturing. Because of this Illyn has become the industrial heart of the system. It�s a common saying that more weapons flow from Illyin than water in its rivers.  The rampant over-industrialization has resulted in extreme levels of pollution that have reduced its temperature even lower than regular tundra worlds as not enough light can get in. Most residents have chosen detoxifier lungs as their state substized domain era verified* legally mandated cybernetic. Gang warfare is quite common on this planet as the Mega Corps compete to expand their pseudo-fiefdoms and . A sizable proportion of weapons used across the sector are manufactured here due to the Domain's Laissez-faire policy of letting companies set up shop here.",,,
DR_planet_Burke,CUSTOM,Burke is the breadbasket of the Metternich system. Thousands of farmers slave away under the baking sun alongside the many rivers of this world.  Most rural immigrants to the Domain Reformed are sent to this world to bolster the DR�s weak agriculture sector. This world is also the epicenter of luddic path resistance in the DR. This is because many apostates rediscover their faith through The Witnessing due to how they are treated. A massive guerrilla war is constantly being waged between the DR military and Luddic Path terrorists across the dunes. ,,,
DR_planet_Maistre,CUSTOM,"Mariste is a brutal prison world.  The people who reside here are career criminals, political prisoners, terrorists, and the few brave pioneers willing to tough it out for great riches. On this world, hundreds of criminals slave away digging up the mineral riches of the world to fuel the arms manufacturing sector. They are locked in battle with the jungle and the local megafauna for survival. A steady stream of outside personnel is necessary to keep the population steady. ",,,

#Ships,,,,,
shinano,SHIP,"The Shinano class were the first true supercarriers in the Persean sector. A point of pride among the reconstructionist admiralty A support carrier meant to augment fleets instead of serving as a force in its own right. Many among the more conservative admiralty argue that the Shinano class should replace the Ford, and queen Elizabeth class as flagships due to its very low-tech design. This is even though this design has many flaws and limitations. Most of the systems on board the ship are un-optimized and some are downright unfinished. ",,,
Iowa,SHIP,"The Iowa class are missile battleships dedicated to long-range combat but struggle at close range due to thin armor for their size and lacking flux dissipation.  

Despite being a cheaper counter to the Paragon class than the Yamato class, Reconstructionist admirals dislike it due to their love of guns over missiles, which they view as unreliable.
",,,
wasa,SHIP,"The Wasa class of ships have an incredible broadside potential at the cost of frontal combat ability. The Wasa class easily shreds frigates but struggles with anything larger, including missiles. The first of this class the Domain Reconstructed created navigation Computer had a massive malfunction. Causing it to enter the gravity well of Illyn. Destroying the tallest mountain on the planet, ending global warming, and beginning global cooling.

	This ship makes use of archaic solar sail technology. This allows for an incredible max speed and low fuel consumption at the cost of acceleration.
",,,
StLouis,SHIP,"The most beautiful ship used by the domain and a personal favorite of director Ivanov, this warship can enter and exit the atmosphere with its own power. This has made it a common sight in the many parades Director Ivanov constantly orders. A capable gunboat for those with a love for theatrics.",,,
Trireme,SHIP,A small toop transport with frugal accommodations. This ship makes use of archaic solar sail technology. This allows for an incredible max speed and almost nonexistent fuel consumption at the cost of acceleration. Luddic path zealots are known for using these ships as suicide rams. Human traffickers love these vessels due to their shielded hulls and fast burn speed. The Trireme is a vital economic asset for the reconstructionists.  Ensuring a steady flow of migrants into the domain reformed.,,,
bismark,SHIP,"A favorite among older pirate lords and the more ""disciplinarian inclined"" admirals, the Bismark is an incredibly durable battleship with a very intimidating image, the Bismark-class fills a vital middle point between conquest and a paragon across the sector. with heavy armor and good firepower the Bismark is the backbone of any fleet it finds itself in.  When the first Bismark launched from the Illyn the admirals cheered at the glory of the Dominion. The dockworkers lamented the amount of suffering it had taken to build it, and its soon-to-be sisters.",,,
hosho,SHIP,the Hosho class is a light carrier primarily used to provide fuel and void superiority for small patrols and trade convoys A deeply underappreciated but good ship class.,,,
Queen_Elizabeth,SHIP,"
A superlative manifestation of technological prowess, this advanced super carrier commands a fleet of void craft substantial enough to impose a comprehensive blockade upon an entire celestial sphere. Earning the distinction as the inaugural vessels deployed within this sector, they bear the esteemed appellation of ""super carrier,"" a designation held in the highest esteem by the Dominion Admiralty. The timely and strategic deployment of these formidable entities has unequivocally altered the outcome of entire conflicts. Their favoritism as flagships is unequivocally merited, attributed to the inclusion of a sophisticated built-in command center and potent sensory apparatus.",,,
R_mothership,SHIP,Whenever a Domain mother ship is found out in the deep void the domain Reformed Spares no expense in restoring them to active duty in one role or another. These ships are considered a relic to be protected and cared for like a lost child. The Most common role these ships fill is as a strategic logistic support ship. A single one of these is enough to provide enough supplies for an entire planetary invasion.,,,
petya,SHIP,An relatively advanced ship by domain reformed standards. Using a lot of midline grade technology this missile frigate is a good old dependable ship with an impressive missile barrage. A great ship for an patient captain with an love of tundra worlds.,,,
Virginia,SHIP,"The Virginia class is more a floating wedge of steel than a warship. The Virginia class is an excellent brawler with a great barrage, versatile weapon load out, and crazy levels of armor. This ship has an rivalry with the monitor for which frigate class is the most durable",,,
Wichita,SHIP,A heavy cruiser with impressive firepower and heavy Armour The Witicha class in a great brawler that form the front line of domain and pirate fleets.,,,
indianopolis,SHIP,A heavy cruiser with incredible PD layout the Indianapolis is the solution to any  bombing run. Theses are usually deployed against high tech and midline fleets to counter powerful wings.,,,
popov,SHIP,The single most hated ship in use by domain. The Popov is a nearly indestructible circle of Armour with a gun too large for its flux network and a nonexistent pd capability. their crews are notorious for vacuum proof armor dreading the moment when the next missile slams into the hull.,,,
Conte_di_Cavour,SHIP,A very unique battleship design with only heavy weapon mounts.  This Conte_di_Cavour  is quite controversial due to it's requirement of heavy weapons to be available and the abysmally slow speed.,,,
yorktown,SHIP,A low tech replacement for an Astral. The York town class has  impressive wing manufacturing ability for it's price and an absurd amount of pd weapons and surprisingly difficult to destroy. This class of ships is incredibly well loved by   It's a good ship just keep it away from the front lines.,,,
Moskva,SHIP,A missile cruiser with incredible alpha strike capability. It's designed to be a hard counter to capital-class carriers or anything that can't get out of the way of it's missiles  ,,,
Furious,SHIP,A medium carrier that provides flexibility and support.  This is the most common and useful ship in the domain's fleets. It's proven vital in creating patrols to counter Luddic path fleets trying to resupply terrorists on Burke. ,,,
Lion,SHIP,"An improvement on the legion battle carrier design with a smaller frontal profile, better flux dissipation, and armor layout.
Before the collapse, on the world now known as New Terra a pair of college students in the Viotov College of Engineering came into possession of an experimental AI core. While looking for a buyer they forced the ai core to retrofit ancient Terran water-based warship designs to function as void-craft for their amusement. The lion class is the first of these redesigns. It was before further restrictions and instructions were placed on the AI to stay closer to the original design. Eventually the students were found out and the blueprints became a novelty among intellectual groups.  The lion class is more inspired by rather than a retrofit.  It provides all the capability of a legion battle carrier with an improved frontal profile and better flux network. The quality of the design is a testament to the intelligence that designed its brilliance.",,,
Tashkent,SHIP,"The Tashkent class is a super destroyer with , by DR standards, great speed. The ship has found its primary use in the sector as a decent combat freighter because of that great speed and large cargo bay. Smugglers have found a particular liking for the ship.",,,
yamato,SHIP,One of the largest ships in the sector the Yamato class is the DR’s equivalent to the paragon. The Yamato-class has near impervious Armour and impressive fire power at the cost of speed and you would have to be blind to miss something this large.,,,
Ford,SHIP,"More a massive floating city than a ship the ford class are the perfect ships to act as the heart for an invasion fleet. The ford class can sustain  a huge amount of fighter craft ,and is quite durable due to the size is Armour effect. The construction of a single one of these requires the combined effort of multiple planets. 

Many admirals in the Domain Reformed dislike these ships due to the advanced technology used in some parts and the reputation the ship has for malfunctions.
",,,
Geobukseon,SHIP,The Geobukseon class is a holding ship with great staying power and decent broadside. It is the anvil to an bombing runs hammer. Geobukseon crews are infamous for weaning power armor dreading the moment when the next missile slams into the hull.,,,
tiger,SHIP,"
The Tiger-class vessel finds itself bereft of a definitive purpose. Its scant armor and limited armament render it inadequate for proper warship designation, yet its modest cargo capacity precludes its categorization as a freighter. The solitary redemption of this vessel lies in its remarkable adaptability for extensive modifications. Regrettably, the meager few Tigers that come into existence are often offloaded onto unsuspecting captains lacking discernment. Perhaps, in due course, a configuration shall be discovered that bestows utility upon this ship, but presently, it remains a somewhat unsightly and as yet unfulfilled entity.",,,

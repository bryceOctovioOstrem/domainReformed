The Eventide gendarmes PMC is a small elite force hailing from the world of Eventide. Eventide gendarmes only hire employees from the evertide “ aristocracy”, and rarely the Eochu Bres “aristocracy"" when. The members of the PMC are encouraged to take pride in their and the PMC's heritage, martial skills, and the ideals of chivalry. The halls of a gendarmerie are often filled with the sound of sword duels and the smell of fine dining. Most employees of the company will hire servants to handle their non-combat-related duties.  The result is 5 servants for every aristocrat on average, and most work is done by non-company personnel. Their primary product is policing services. The Eventide gendarmes are more of a heavily armed police than true soldiers. Every policing action is done with the maximum amount of brutality they can get away with to minimize casualties. ",,

They specialize in protecting industrial assets(mostly mines), operating in Inimical Biospheres, and jungle fighting, and protected shipping.  The Wendigos demand a cut of all produce from any mine they protect, especially organics. They also have a high preference for capital ships and combat freighters.
The Wendigos do not allow any outsider to see them eat, and the higher-ups refuse to allow anyone to see their faces. They also erect strange bone piles nearby. Every new member is required to sign a large number of NDAs. None of this has any known equivalent on Jangala.

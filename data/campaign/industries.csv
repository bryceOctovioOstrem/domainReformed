The Eventide gendarmes PMC is a small elite force hailing from the world of Eventide. Eventide gendarmes only hire employees from the evertide “ aristocracy”, and rarely the Eochu Bres “aristocracy"" when. The members of the PMC are encouraged to take pride in their and the PMC's heritage, martial skills, and the ideals of chivalry. The halls of a gendarmerie are often filled with the sound of sword duels and the smell of fine dining. Most employees of the company will hire servants to handle their non-combat-related duties.  The result is 5 servants for every aristocrat on average, and most work is done by non-company personnel. Their primary product is policing services. The Eventide gendarmes are more of a heavily armed police than true soldiers. Every policing action is done with the maximum amount of brutality they can get away with to minimize casualties. ",,

They are a support group as much as a band of mercenaries. They now profit from oppressing the very people they once called brothers and sisters.  They still fight in the same way as they did when they served the church due to a sense of familiarity. Despite a recent hostile takeover from their founder High Admiral Dux Saigo the Ronin PMC remains a very profitable and effective company.,,
